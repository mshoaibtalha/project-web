#### HTML image

Pages looks much better if we use some images .With the help of HTML it is very easy to show images in the pages.

We can use use many CSS properties inline can can change size,boarder and colour.

```html
<h2>HTML image</h2>
    <img src="/html/images/house.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="House" />
  
```

The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The `<img>` tag  does not have a closing tag.

The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:

- src - Specifies the path to the image

- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
